TODO

- Refactoring is the word of the day, put all the code that are in
functions inside classes keeping the scope and encapsulation.

- Make update run in it's own thread so you wont't need to wait for
it to download every comic. With that make it possible to stop the
update, and restart it without the need of closing the program.

- Make a GUI.
